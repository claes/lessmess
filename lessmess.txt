[ ] Icons with colors that corresponds to status colors

[+] Nicer color scheme

[ ] Scroll timeline according to click on todos

[ ] One-file-bundle

[+] CSS for printing

[ ] Improve parsing of textual info

[+] List contexts

[+] Lists projects

[ ] Generate ical events using data uris

[>] Tab panel with statistics

[ ] Calendar component

[ ] Sort on status

[>] Filter on status

[ ] Status 'ignore' etc

[ ] Keyboard control

[ ] Different 'zoom levels'

[ ] Persistence of user settings (cookie?)

[ ] Fancier styling

[ ] Improved date parsing. More formats supported etc

[+] Scoll and highlight clicks on timeline

[+] Example with contexts: @phone @email

[>] Another example with contexts: @email

[ ] Example with dates due:2009-06-01

Markdown cheat sheet
====================

## Header 2 ##
### Header 3 ###
#### Header 4 ####
##### Header 5 #####

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace.
Paragraphs can be on one line (or many), and can drone on
for hours.   Here is a Markdown link to [Google](http://www.google.com), 
and a literal. 
A picture: ![picture alt](http://images.google.se/images/isr_g.png "Google image")     

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, and `code()`.

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  
 
Horizontal rule

Simple table:

  Right     Left     Center     Default   
-------     ------ ----------   -------   
     12     12        12            12    
    123     123       123          123
